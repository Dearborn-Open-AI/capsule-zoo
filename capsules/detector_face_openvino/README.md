# About the Capsule
## Usage
This capsule is for detecting faces in video. 

## Model
### Architecture & Performance
The network features a default MobileNet backbone that includes depth-wise 
convolutions to reduce the amount of computation for the 3x3 convolution block.

###  Model File Origin
The pretrained model was downloaded from the [OpenCV Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo). 
For more information on this specific model, see its
